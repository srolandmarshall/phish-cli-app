# Sam's Phish Gem

# Objectives

1. Create a gem that allows me to browse shows and songs performed by Phish
2. User will pick a tour, then pick a show, and then be able to find out info about specific songs. At any point they can back out a layer.

# Overview

I really like Phish, and would really like to make something using them as one of my projects. They have a great fan-made site available at http://phish.net that pain-stakingly catalogues every show (in their known history) and their setlists. I thought it would be cool to be able to browse this using CLI and to have a few nifty nuggets as well like `lastshow` printing out the setlist from their most recent show.

I plan on doing this using Nokogiri and Open-URI, though I may need a few other things along the way.
